    "The Monty Hall Problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a very famous problem in Probability Theory. It can be described as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you are on a game-show where you can win a car if you find behind which door it is. There are three closed doors (\"\\{0,1,2\\}\") and only behind one of them there is a car; behind the others, there is a goat. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Monty_open_door.png\" style=\"width:300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two opportunities to pick a door. Firstly, you have to pick one among all three doors. Say you pick Door #1, and the Host, the person in charge who knows where the car is, opens **another** door, say Door #0, which has a goat. Then, you are given a second opportunity to choose again. The Host asks to you: \"Do you want to keep Door #1 or would you prefer changing to Door #2?\"\n",

    "According to the available information, should the Player change her mind?"
